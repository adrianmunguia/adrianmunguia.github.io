### Contraband Detection: X-Ray Image Registration for the VACIS XPL (EasyMatch).
In the case study of "EasyMatch - Enhancing Contraband Detection in VACIS-XPL," the challenge was to address visual inspection fatigue among operators scanning X-ray images in the Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System - XPL (VACIS-XPL). Over a period of 5 months, spanning R&D to engineering, the team identified the inefficiency of the existing method and developed EasyMatch—a novel image difference approach to aid operators in quickly detecting hidden contraband. The key challenges included non-linear warping in X-ray scans due to factors like vehicle speed variations and sensor heat. The team implemented the SIFT algorithm, adapted it in C++, and addressed outlier rejection to ensure accuracy. Overcoming challenges with OpenCV's SVD implementation, the team successfully implemented a 3D polynomial non-linear transformation warping model. EasyMatch significantly improved detection capabilities, reduced visual inspection fatigue, enhanced operational efficiency during high traffic flow, and became a core component integrated into SAIC's Vehicle and Cargo Inspection Systems, achieving substantial commercial success.
